- 👋 Hi, I’m @travgregor
- 👀 I’m interested in ...becoming more familiar within this space...coding, cloud engineering, network and system analysis, all of it. I'm brand new to this, no experience with coding other C++ about 7 years ago.
- 🌱 My current undertaking ... to learn Python as many have said it is probably the best language to learn as a beginner in this space.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...anything! How can I help, what can I learn, I'll just watch and listen :)
